The process is automated so there is no interaction involved.

##Update Process

The following steps happen on a daily basis to update the non-customized spenders.

###A. Initial Role Assignment

This table shows the positions from the Finance Security (Matrix) that are considered "spenders" (i.e. have spending privileges) and the spending role that each is assigned.

###Financial Statements
All of the pivot tables we use are located in a single network folder (“data warehouse folder”).  

The path to that folder is: \\rhs\rhs-dfs\RHSRA\   

The first time you click that link and open the folder, go to the “Documents” subfolder and drag the shortcut there to your desktop.  That will give you a fast and easy way to get to this folder from now on.

Each of the files in this folder load data when you open them.  They load only data for the costcenters you are assigned in the finance security (maintained by Sherri Dobbins).

In the main directory, all of the files load data for the current accounting period.  The current accounting period switches each month on the third or fourth business day.  To access data for a previous month, open the “Historical” folder and use the files located there.  Unlike those in the main directory that auto-load current data, these files will prompt you for an accounting period (entered as “2015-05-31” minus the quotes).  You can see periods going back to 2009 here.
